## 🎯 Key Points

### How Assets Work:

Your design uses the **`figma:asset`** import system:

```typescript
// Example from Hero.tsx
import heroImage from "/assets/da605094cb31f2234ddc211b461c4f629644f6f1.png";

// Example from Gallery.tsx
import photo1 from "/assets/e1937c6adae6bf559090e418acb7846ae1a7a759.png";
import photo2 from "/assets/6f166b2928e714b52302148ffae7bced0dd80dcd.png";
```

**What This Means:**

- ✅ All 27 images from your Figma design are automatically handled
- ✅ Vite build process resolves these imports
- ✅ Images are optimized during build
- ✅ No manual image management needed
- ✅ Everything works automatically!

### Build Process:

When you run `npm run build`:

1. Vite resolves all `figma:asset` imports
2. Optimizes and bundles all images
3. Minifies JavaScript and CSS
4. Creates production-ready `/dist` folder
5. Everything is included and optimized

### What You Deploy:

The `/dist` folder contains:

- ✅ Optimized HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ✅ All 27 images from your design
- ✅ All routes pre-configured
- ✅ Everything needed for production
